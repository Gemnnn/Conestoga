                    <P>Wine has been produced for thousands of years.
                        The earliest evidence of wine is from ancient China (7000 BC), 
                        Georgia (6000 BC), Iran (5000 BC), and Sicily (4000 BC). New World 
                        wine has some connection to alcoholic beverages made by the indigenous 
                        peoples of the Americas, but is mainly connected to later Viking area 
                        of Vinland and Spanish traditions in New Spain. Later, as Old World wine 
                        further developed viticulture techniques, Europe would encompass three 
                        of the largest wine-producing regions. Today, the five countries with 
                        the largest wine-producing regions are in Italy, Spain, France, 
                        the United States, and China.</P>
                    <p>Wine has long played an important role in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians 
                        and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans 
                        in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, 
                        and Christianity in the Eucharist. Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli 
                        wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. Similarly the 
                        largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in 
                        connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the 
                        Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars 
                        and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California.</p>

                    <p>The earliest known traces of wine are from ancient China 
                        (c. 7000 BC), Georgia (c. 6000 BC), Iran (Persia) (c. 5000 BC), 
                        and Sicily (c. 4000 BC). Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was 
                        consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout 
                        history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.</p>
                    <p>In 2017 the research led by Dr. Patrick E. McGovern, Scientific Director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia acknowledged Georgia as the birthplace of wine.</p>
                    <p>The earliest archaeological and archaeobotanical evidence for grape wine and viniculture, dating to 6000–5800 BC was found on the territory of modern Georgia. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine elsewhere was relatively later, likely having taken place in the Southern Caucasus (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region between Eastern Turkey, and northern Iran.</p>
