                        <p>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grape juice. Yeast consumes the sugar
                         in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. Different varieties of grapes
                         and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine.</p> 
                        <p>These variations result from the complex
                         interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation,
                         the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the production process. Many countries enact legal
                         appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical
                         origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.
                         Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops including,
                         rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, currant and elderberry.

                        <p>Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. 
                        The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, 
                        typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines 
                        and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes 
                        is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments 
                        (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; 
                        exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, 
                        which produce a red-colored juice. Much of the red-wine production 
                        process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from 
                        the grape skin. It is a delicacy around the world.</p>

                        <p>The first step in red wine production, after picking, 
                        involves physical processing of the grapes.</p>

                        <p>White wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, 
                            yellow-green, or yellow-gold.[1] It is produced by the alcoholic 
                            fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of
                             any colour. White wine has existed for at least 2500 years.</p>
                        <p>The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, 
                            methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly 
                            from "white" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the 
                            Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Riesling. Some white wine is also made 
                            from grapes with coloured skin, provided that the obtained wort 
                            is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce 
                            champagne.</p>
                        <p>Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common.</p>
